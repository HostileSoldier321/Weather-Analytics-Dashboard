# 🌦️ Weather Analytics Dashboard Using Power BI

## 🧾 Project Overview
This project visualizes and analyzes real-time weather data, including key air quality and atmospheric indicators, using an interactive Power BI dashboard. It focuses on offering insights into environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and particulate matter (PM10), with an emphasis on air quality impact.

## 🧠 Key Insights

### 🌤️ Weather Overview
- Displays current temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure.
- Real-time weather conditions (e.g., clear, cloudy, rainy) are mapped with visual indicators.
- Helps understand how weather patterns change throughout the day or across different locations.

### 🌫️ Air Quality Index (AQI) Monitoring
- PM10 is used as the primary air pollutant indicator.
- AQI levels are categorized as:
  - **Good (0–50)**
  - **Moderate (51–100)**
  - **Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (101–150)**
  - **Unhealthy (151–200)**
  - **Very Unhealthy (201–300)**
  - **Hazardous (300+)**
- Color-coded status provides quick visual cues on the health risk associated with air quality.
- Useful for individuals with respiratory conditions or environmental researchers.

### 🌡️ Temperature & Humidity Trends
- Temperature and humidity readings are plotted to reveal patterns and anomalies.
- This helps identify weather shifts or periods of discomfort (e.g., high temp + high humidity).

### 📈 Time-Series Trends
- Dynamic visualization of how weather indicators (like AQI, temperature) change over time.
- Useful for spotting long-term pollution trends or sudden atmospheric changes.

### 🗺️ Geographic Relevance
- Designed to support multi-location analytics (can be extended with map visuals).
- Ideal for local weather reporting, city comparison, or pollution heatmap creation.
